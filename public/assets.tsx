The Oak trees here are very old and stunted, with their branches twisted and knotted into fantastical shapes. Wistman Wood has been mentioned in writing for hundreds of years. It is likely to be a leftover from the ancient forest that covered much of Dartmoor 7000 BC. The wood has been the inspiration for numerous artists, poets, photographers and appears in hundreds of nineteenth-century accounts.'
